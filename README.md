# h2o-zeeshan
This repository contains instructions on how to run your own H2O.ai docker image

Step 1:
Install Docker

Step 2: 
Run this command to run H2O docker image:
docker run -ti zeecitizen/h2o-zeeshan:latest

You're done. Now you can launch the H2O instance in your browser by typing the ip address given in output such as:

INFO: Open H2O Flow in your web browser: http://172.17.0.2:54321

The command in Step2 pulls the H2O.ai image saved at this docker repository location: 'docker pull zeecitizen/h2o-zeeshan' and runs it. 

Cheers,
